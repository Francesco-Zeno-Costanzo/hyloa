Installing the package
==============================

To install the HYLOA package, you can use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    "to do"

If you want to install it directly from the GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Francesco-Zeno-Costanzo/hyloa.git
    cd hyloa
    pip install -e .

If you're on Windows and prefer not to use the terminal, simply:

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.
2. Inside the extracted folder, double-click on:

   .. code-block:: none

      run_ha.bat

This will automatically install everything you need and create a desktop shortcut to launch the GUI.
